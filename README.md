# RUN PROJECT

Node version >= 14 is required to run the project.
Personally I use node v16.20.1

Clone this project via http then `npm i` on project root and `npm run dev` to run the project.

Note: There's a default header that I use to navigate between the finished task faster. Navigate to `Admin Panel` for admin panel's task and `Landing Page` for the landing page task.

I've should use global variable for css (css's enviroment variables setup). I'm still learning Tailwind... but I'm getting better ðŸ¥‚
